          <p class="card-text">The NYPL was an interesting option because the website features a wealth of content and information that is noticeably displayed in a confusing and jarring way. Immediately upon viewing the website all of our group members became cognizant that this website lacks an ideal user experience. 
            <br>
            Throughout our process, we executed a survey and held multiple one-on-one interviews, thus garnering a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. Based on our research, we determined how prospective users wanted to interact with the NYPL website.
            <br>
            After that, we dove into a heuristic evaluation to determine the flaws of the website. We then analyzed four competitors, two of which were direct, the London (UK) and Toronto libraries, and two of which were indirect, Indigo and TYPE books. 
            <br>
            All of this helped us determine what the problem with the NYPL’s website was and how we could solve the issue.

      <h5 class="card-title text-center my-section-header">Defining The Problem</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Based on all of the data we generated during our research and discovery phase, we created a user persona — Bruno Gonzalez. 
          <br>
        He’s a 30-year-old service worker who wants to go back to school and doesn’t want to spend his savings buying all of the books he needs to do so. 
        <br>
    Next, we created a user-centred Problem Statement…
        <br>
        “The New York Public Library has a complicated main page that makes it difficult for prospective users to figure out what they can access with a membership. Users want to know what functions and benefits can be gained from a New York Library card and can’t accomplish that easily by navigating the website. 
        <br>
        Simplifying the main page of the New York Public Library’s website will make it easier for users, such as Bruno, to access the resources they need. Furthermore, a well-organized main page with simple navigation will draw in more prospective users to join the library.”

      <h5 class="card-title text-center my-section-header">Information Architecture</h5>
      <p class="card-text">A key for our redesign was simplifying the information architecture of the NYPL website. 
<br>
        As it stands, the website has a global navigation with Log In, Locations, Get A Library Card, Get Email Updates, and Donate, and a primary navigation of Books, Music, Movies, Research, Education, Events, Connect, Give, Get Help, and a search bar jammed into the corner. There’s also a discover section with 12 randomly placed images with links to various topics. 
        <br>
        We removed the large	amount of content in the middle of the site and added a drop-down menu with importation links to the navigation bar. We also sought to include more prominent information in a carousel that users would see immediately upon landing on the main page.
        <br>
        We also developed a nice and simple user flow for how somebody would register for a library card, which is one of the most important functions of the website. 
        <br>
        Here’s our redesigned Site Map…

      <h5 class="card-title text-center my-section-header">Design Process</h5>
      <p class="card-text">We started our design process with a series of low-fidelity sketches to use as our base. 
        <br>
      From there, we put together an InVision mood board as a group, featuring an array of different pieces of content for inspiration. We included general aesthetics, colour tiles, and website layouts that helped us narrow down how we wanted the website to look after it was re-designed. 
        <br>
         Before worrying about the colours and the icons and more specific aspects of our layout, we put together a mid-fidelity prototype with basic functionality. We executed multiple user tests and gained some quality feedback, such as the need to add a language icon as part of the global navigation and changing the status of the profile icon after the user has logged in.
        <br>
         Finally, we put together our high-fidelity prototype with our chosen colour palette, icons, and a refined primary navigation.
        <br>
        This layout is much, much easier on the eyes than the current website and some major improvements that we believe we made are seen in the well-organized primary navigation and the more simplified featured content shown in the middle of the page.

      <p class="card-text">In summary, we made the New York Public Library’s website more user friendly by making a handful of changes to how the site is laid out and how the information is organized.
<br>
        Through our research process, we learned what potential users are looking for from the site and we determined what users find jarring and frustrating about the current site. 
        <br>
        Based on that, we narrowed down what our main problems were and how to solve them. Our key changes were overhauling the site’s navigation system, adding a visible carousel with key information, and having more book recommendations on the main page.
